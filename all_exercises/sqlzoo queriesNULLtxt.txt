1.List the teachers who have NULL for their department.

SELECT name
FROM teacher
WHERE dept IS NULL

2.Note the INNER JOIN misses the teachers with no department and the departments with no teacher.

SELECT t.name, d.name
FROM teacher t
JOIN dept d
ON t.dept=d.id

3.Use a different JOIN so that all teachers are listed.

SELECT t.name, d.name
FROM teacher t
LEFT JOIN dept d
ON t.dept = d.id

4.Use a different JOIN so that all departments are listed.

SELECT t.name, d.name
FROM teacher t
RIGHT JOIN dept d
ON t.dept = d.id

5.Show teacher name and mobile number or '07986 444 2266' using COALESCE.

SELECT name, COALESCE(mobile, '07986 444 2266')
FROM teacher

6.Use the COALESCE function and a LEFT JOIN to print the teacher name and department name. Use the string 'None' where there is no department.

SELECT t.name, COALESCE(d.name, 'None')
FROM teacher t
LEFT JOIN dept d
ON d.id = t.dept

7.Use COUNT to show the number of teachers and the number of mobile phones.

SELECT COUNT(name) AS teacher_qty,COUNT(mobile) AS phone_qty
FROM teacher

8.Use COUNT and GROUP BY dept.name to show each department and the number of staff.

SELECT d.name, COUNT(t.name)
FROM dept d
LEFT JOIN teacher t
ON d.id = t.dept
GROUP BY d.name

9.Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2 and 'Art' otherwise.

SELECT name, 
      (CASE 
       WHEN (dept = 1 OR dept = 2) THEN 'Sci'
       ELSE 'Art' 
       END) AS dpt       
FROM teacher

10.Use CASE to show the name of each teacher followed by 'Sci' if the teacher is in dept 1 or 2, show 'Art' if the teacher's dept is 3 and 'None' otherwise.

SELECT name,
       (CASE
        WHEN dept IN (1,2) THEN 'Sci'
        WHEN dept IS NULL THEN 'None'
        ELSE 'Art'
        END) AS dept
FROM teacher
